# CMOS 300nm Technology Design and Simulation of some sequential circuits

This repository contains the design and simulation files for various digital circuits implemented using CMOS 300nm technology. The designs include N-latch, P-latch, rising edge Flip-Flop, and falling edge Flip-Flop. The Electric IDE was used for schematic and layout design, and LTspice was utilized for simulation.
